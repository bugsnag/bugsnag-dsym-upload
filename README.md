### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

Install via the Homebrew formula:

```
brew install bugsnag/tap/bugsnag-dsym-upload
```

This will also add the Bugsnag Homebrew tap for future updates.

### [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools)

Add `bugsnag` as a plugin in your configuration:

```
fastlane add_plugin bugsnag
```

Then add the `upload_symbols_to_bugsnag` action to your lane:

```ruby
lane :refresh_dsyms do
  download_dsyms(version: "1.4.2.1")     # Download dSYM files from App Store Connect
  upload_symbols_to_bugsnag              # Upload them to Bugsnag
  clean_build_artifacts                  # Delete the local dSYM files
end
```

Common options:

* `api_key`: The API key associated with the project. Informs Bugsnag which project 
  the dSYMs should be applied to.
* `dsym_path`: A path or array of paths for directories containing \*.dSYM files
  or a single \*.zip file to upload. If unspecified, the default behavior is to
  upload the zip files retrieved by a prior invocation of
  [`download_dsyms`](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/#download_dsyms), or
  any .dSYM files within the current directory.
* `upload_url`: The URL of the server receiving symbol files. Update this value
  if you are using a private instance of Bugsnag
* `config_file`: The path to the project's Info.plist. Set this value if your configuration file 
  is not automatically detected.

View usage additional usage information and options by running:
